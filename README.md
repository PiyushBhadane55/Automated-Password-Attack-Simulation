"# Automated-Password-Attack-Simulation" 

This project simulates brute-force attacks on target systems by automatically attempting passwords from a predefined list. It supports testing Windows SMB shares and SSH logins on Linux-based systems, displaying each attempt and stopping immediately when a valid password is found. The tool demonstrates password security weaknesses in a controlled, ethical environment.


SSH (Secure Shell): A protocol for secure remote login and command execution on a system, typically used for Linux/Unix machines, encrypting all communication.

SMB (Server Message Block): A network protocol for sharing files, folders, and printers over a network, mostly used on Windows systems.
